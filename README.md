# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I am Gaurav

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a computer engineering student at Don Bosco Institute of Technology with a passion for problem-solving, gaming, and AI/ML. I'm excited to share with you some of the projects I've worked on.

## Interests
Apart from coding, I'm an avid gamer and love playing games in my free time. I'm also interested in AI/ML and am always exploring ways to incorporate them into my projects.

## Skills
I possess a strong foundation in C++ programming and problem-solving, as well as experience in Python programming. Additionally, I have experience in game development and am constantly learning new techniques to enhance my skills.

## Projects
Here are a few notable projects I've worked on:

### 1. SkyGliders
SkyGliders is a mobile game that I developed and uploaded on the Play Store. It's a fun and addictive game that challenges players to fly a plane through various obstacles. You can download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Teknack.SkyGliders&hl=en_US&gl=US).

### 2. The Lone Bot
The Lone Bot is another game that I developed and uploaded on the Play Store. It's a side-scrolling adventure game where the player navigates through obstacles and enemies. You can download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The%20Lone%20Bot&c=apps&hl=en_US&gl=US).

## Message
Through my projects and skills, I hope to inspire other developers to push the limits of what's possible and create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

Thanks for stopping by!
